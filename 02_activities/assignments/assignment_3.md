# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```

Gapminder - Global Trends in Life Expectancy and Income

Accessibility
Gapminderâ€™s design is mostly accessible due to its clean layout and interactive features. According to Ware (2012), effective visualizations use clear visual cues, and Gapminder achieves this with hoverable tooltips and a well-structured interface. However, its reliance on color to represent regions can exclude color-blind users, as Few (2006) points out. Adding patterns or textures to bubbles and regions could help. Additionally, the heavy focus on visuals makes it hard for screen readers to convey key information, limiting access for visually impaired users.

Reproducibility
While Gapminder provides raw data and source references, it lacks details about how the data is processed, cleaned, or adjusted, which are key for reproducibility (Munzner, 2014). For example, users donâ€™t know how missing data is handled or how life expectancy is interpolated for gaps in records. Without this, other researchers or users cannot fully replicate the findings or build upon them, as Kirk (2019) emphasizes.

Equity
Gapminder supports equity by including data from a wide range of countries and regions, following Dâ€™Ignazio and Kleinâ€™s (2020) principle of giving visibility to underrepresented groups. However, smaller nations can be overshadowed by large bubbles representing populous countries like China or India. This makes it harder to notice trends from these regions, which could limit the fairness of the visualization.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Your answer...

Accessibility:
Use patterns or shapes in addition to colors for bubbles and regions to support color-blind users. Add text descriptions for key trends to make it compatible with screen readers.

Reproducibility:
Share details about data processing, including how missing data is handled or how trends are smoothed. This will help others verify or replicate the analysis.

Equity:
Highlight smaller countries by adding notes or annotations for their specific trends. Adjust bubble scaling slightly to avoid small nations being overshadowed by larger ones.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:
