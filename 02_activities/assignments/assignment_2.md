# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

      Your answer...
A very classic data visualization: Gapminder - Global Trends in Life Expectancy and Income

1. Dynamic Interactivity: The interactive timeline allows users to observe changes in global life expectancy and income trends across different decades. This feature vividly illustrates how life expectancy evolves in relation to economic development over time. Smooth bubble animations make transitions easy to follow, enhancing the overall user experience.

2. Flexible Multi-Dimensional Data Presentation: The visualization offers extensive customization, allowing users to adjust bubble size (e.g., population or other metrics) and color (e.g., regions or custom attributes) based on their preferences or specific queries. This flexibility makes it easier to explore and interpret complex relationships tailored to individual needs.

3. Clear and Intuitive Design: Despite presenting a large volume of information, the visualization avoids feeling overwhelming. The natural and thoughtful color choices, combined with a clean layout, ensure the data remains accessible and engaging for users.

4. User-Focused Experience: By integrating dynamic interactivity and flexible settings, the visualization empowers users to explore data at their own pace, tailoring the experience to their interests and enabling deeper insights into the connections between economic and health indicators.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?

      Your answer...
1. Add Narrative Annotations: To enhance the storytelling aspect of the visualization, narrative annotations could be added to highlight significant global events that have shaped trends.
For example:
- 2008 Financial Crisis: Show how the crisis impacted global income levels, especially in developing nations. An annotation could explain why some regions experienced stagnant or declining income during this period.
- COVID-19 Pandemic (2020-2021): Illustrate how the pandemic caused disruptions in life expectancy, particularly in regions with overwhelmed healthcare systems. Highlight key statistics, such as the drop in average life expectancy in countries like the U.S. or India.
- Industrialization in Asia (1980s): Annotate the rapid economic growth in China and Southeast Asia, linking it to a sharp rise in life expectancy due to improved healthcare access and living standards.
Enhance Accessibility Features (Additional Improvement):
Currently, the visualization heavily relies on color to convey regions and bubble size for population, which may exclude users with visual impairments (e.g., color blindness). To address this:

2. Add text labels to key bubbles so that users can directly identify countries without relying on hover actions.
Use patterns or textures for bubbles or axes, providing alternative ways to distinguish data points.
Ensure screen readers can describe the key data for each country, making the tool usable for people with visual disabilities.
Why Accessibility is Crucial:
Improving accessibility broadens the reach of the visualization, ensuring that diverse audiences, including those with disabilities, can engage with the data. This is especially important for tools like Gapminder that aim to educate users globally.

By incorporating narrative annotations and accessibility improvements, Gapminder could provide a richer, more inclusive experience while deepening usersâ€™ understanding of global historical and social dynamics.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
